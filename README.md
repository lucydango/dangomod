Adds adorable dango creatures from TFT to Dwarf Fortress!

Dangos are hunting and war trainable, fear their fierce bites! They are also naturally occurring in the wild. They are breedable and butcherable for the fruit, flour and sugar that makes up their bodies, but you would never do that, would you?

Different dangos have different personalities! Base dangos are a blank slate, gingersnap dangos are known to be mischievous, and sugar crash dangos have a dark secret you'll have to discover for yourself...
