[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:Adds adorable dango creatures from TFT to Dwarf Fortress!

Dangos are hunting and war trainable, fear their fierce bites! They are also naturally occurring in the wild. They are breedable and butcherable for their fruit, but you would never do that, would you?

Different dangos have different personalities! Base dangos are a blank slate, gingersnap dangos are known to be mischeivious, and sugar crash dangos have a dark secret you'll have to discover for yourself...]
